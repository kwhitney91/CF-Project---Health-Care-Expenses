# CF-Project---Health-Care-Expenses

I am looking at synthesized  data created about health care costs expenses in the United States to answer key questions about why health care costs what it does.. Below I will identify several possible variables, and test them out using various methods including geographical visualization, regression analysis and K-means clustering. I will then analyze the results and examine the different trends and conclusions drawn from the data.

Data Source - 
For this project, I plan to Medical Cost Personal Dataset found through Kaggle 
[Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data)

Because it is from Kaggle it is therefore an external data source. The original data is a synthetic set that was created for the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz. Since the data is synthetic, that means it was made up and artificially manufactured.

Questions to Explore
Which region has the highest price of coverage?
What is the distribution of the population surveys across the different regions?
Is BMI or age more important in determining how much someone pays for insurance?
Is there an even representation of males and females in the data set?
Is there more of an impact on insurance charges rates for females with children than males?
What other data categories are there that might have an impact on the charges?
What is the average a smoker pays vs that of a non-smoker?
Can a model from this data accurately predict the insurance costs of a new person added to the data set?
